## üìú The History and Evolution of Methodologies

### The Waterfall Model: Origins and Limitations

In the early era of software development, the **Waterfall model** predominated, formalized by Winston Royce in 1970. This model established a linear and sequential development flow, where each phase had to be completely finished before the next one began:

1. Requirements gathering
2. Analysis and design
3. Implementation (coding)
4. Testing
5. Deployment
6. Maintenance

The **systems analyst** was the central figure in this model, acting as a bridge between business and developers. Responsible for exhaustively documenting requirements and transforming them into technical specifications, this professional played a crucial role in translating between two worlds.

Although it offered **comprehensive documentation**, **well-defined processes**, and **clarity in deliverables**, Waterfall suffered from critical problems:

- Inflexibility to accommodate changes
- Late customer feedback (only in the final phases)
- Long time until the first functional delivery
- Accumulated risks in the final phases of the project

As highlighted by Boehm (1988), the cost of correcting a defect increases exponentially as the project progresses. Pressman (2014) also observed that projects that rigidly follow the Waterfall model frequently fail to meet end-user expectations.

### The Agile Revolution and Scrum

In response to the limitations of the Waterfall model, the **Agile movement** emerged, formalized in 2001 with the Agile Manifesto. Among the agile methodologies, **Scrum** stood out as one of the most adopted, proposing iterative and incremental development.

Scrum, as described by Schwaber and Sutherland (2020), brought a radically different approach:

- Short development cycles (Sprints)
- Incremental and functional deliveries
- Constant adaptation to changes
- Direct collaboration between team and stakeholders
- Team self-management

This approach eliminated the centralized figure of the systems analyst, distributing the responsibility of understanding and translating the business to the entire team, with the **Business/Product Specialist** assuming the role of prioritizing what generates the most value.

## üîç The Current Scenario: Challenges and Contradictions

Today, many organizations have adopted structures with separate **Product** and **Engineering** areas. The Product area, often pressured by the business, establishes deadlines and scope (often called "W degree") without a deep understanding of the technical challenges involved in implementation.

In this context, the figure of the **Technical Specialist** (such as Team Leaders, Tech Leads, and others with similar functions) emerged, informally assuming the role that previously belonged to the systems analyst: translating business requirements into viable technical solutions. This need emerged because the agile model, by distributing responsibilities, created a gap at the interface between business and technology.

As projects progress, complications arise:

- Technical limitations are discovered late
- Business rules prove more complex than initially understood
- Non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability) impose unforeseen constraints
- Teams are formed without clear direction, both technical and business-wise

The result is a cycle of frustration, with desperate attempts to meet increasingly unrealistic deadlines, sacrificing quality, scope, or both.

## üí° Our Proposal: The DV Framework

Given the described scenario, the **Deliver-Value Framework (DV)** is born, a methodology that seeks to reconcile business needs with technical realities, prioritizing the value of delivery.

This framework recognizes that the problem is not in the dates or scope themselves, but in how they are established and in the inflexibility to adjust them when new technical challenges arise.

Some key principles of the DV Framework:

- Recovery of the "translator" role between business and technology through the **Value Analyst**
- Preliminary technical assessment process before committing to deadlines
- Formal mechanisms for renegotiation when technical limitations arise
- Constant focus on real value for the customer, not just meeting dates

The framework also recognizes that there are regulatory deadlines and commercial commitments that need to be respected. In these cases, it proposes a transparent process of scope and resource negotiation, keeping the focus on essential value.

## ‚ú® Why the DV Framework?

The DV Framework fills a critical gap in current methodologies:

- **Combines the best of both worlds**: The clarity of Waterfall with the flexibility of Agile
- **Resolves the disconnect** between Product and Engineering areas
- **Formalizes processes** that already happen informally in many organizations
- **Prioritizes real value** ov
