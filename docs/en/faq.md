## General Questions

### What is the DV?

The Deliver-Value Framework (DV) is a methodology that seeks to reconcile business needs with technical realities by prioritizing the delivery of value. It was developed to fill gaps found at the interface between Product/Business and Engineering/Technology areas, establishing formal mechanisms for translation, negotiation, and renegotiation of commitments.

### How does the DV differ from agile methodologies like Scrum?

While agile methodologies like Scrum focus on iterative and incremental delivery, the DV complements these approaches with:

1. Restoration of the formal "translator" role between business and technology (Value Analyst)
2. Structured process for preliminary technical assessment before commitment
3. Formal mechanisms for renegotiation when technical limitations arise
4. Greater emphasis on defining and measuring real delivered value

The DV does not replace agile methodologies but resolves common friction points in their implementation.

### Does the DV only work for software development?

No. Although it was initially conceived in the context of software development, the principles of the DV can be applied to any context where there is an interface between "what needs to be done" (business needs) and "how it will be done" (technical implementation). This includes areas such as:

- Hardware development
- Service design
- Infrastructure and operations
- Organizational transformation
- Research and development projects

The specific adaptation for each context may vary, but the fundamental principles remain relevant.

### Is the DV appropriate for any type of project?

The DV brings more benefits to projects with the following characteristics:

- Significant technical uncertainty
- Complex interface between business and technical areas
- Need for adaptation over time
- Multiple stakeholders with potentially conflicting expectations

For simple projects with low uncertainty and stable requirements, a simplified version of the DV may be more appropriate.

## Implementation and Adoption

### How do I start implementing the DV in my organization?

We recommend a gradual approach:

1. **Start small**: Select a pilot project of moderate importance (not the most critical, but also not irrelevant)
2. **Identify the roles**: Define who will assume the key roles, especially the Value Analyst
3. **Establish basic practices**: Implement fundamental practices such as the Value Matrix and the Flexibility Contract
4. **Measure and adjust**: Define metrics to assess effectiveness and make adjustments as needed
5. **Gradually expand**: Share learnings and expand to other projects

It is crucial to obtain leadership support and ensure that everyone involved understands the purpose of the framework.

### What are the organizational prerequisites for the DV?

To successfully implement the DV, your organization should have:

1. **Openness to change**: Willingness to question established processes
2. **Transparency**: Culture that values honest communication about challenges and limitations
3. **Focus on value**: Mindset that prioritizes business outcomes over feature delivery
4. **Autonomy**: Space for teams to adapt processes to their needs

These elements do not need to be fully established, but there should be openness to develop them.

### How can the DV be adapted for small teams?

For teams with fewer than 10 people:

1. **Combine roles**: The Technical Specialist can also assume facilitation responsibilities
2. **Simplify artifacts**: Use leaner versions of the Value Matrix and other documents
3. **More informal processes**: Adjust the formality level of renegotiation processes
4. **Focus on essential practices**: Prioritize practices such as Technical Discovery and Flexibility Contract

The important thing is to maintain the key principles even with simplified processes.

### How long does it take to see results with the DV?

The first benefits can be observed in the initial phases of implementation, typically:

- **Short term (1-3 months)**: Better communication between areas and reduced conflicts
- **Medium term (3-6 months)**: Greater predictability in deliveries and reduced rework
- **Long term (6+ months)**: Measurable improvement in business metrics and stakeholder satisfaction

The speed of results depends on the organization's maturity, commitment to change, and the specific context of the projects.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Doesn't creating the Value Analyst role increase bureaucracy?

The Value Analyst role is not intended to add a bureaucratic layer, but to formalize a function that often already exists informally in organizations. Instead of creating bureaucracy, this role:

1. Removes ambiguities about who is responsible for translation between business and technology
2. Avoids inefficient communication between areas
3. Reduces rework caused by misunderstandings
4. Decreases the need for excessive alignment meetings

When implemented correctly, this role increases efficiency, not bureaucracy.

### Who should take on the Value Analyst role?

The ideal profile for a Value Analyst is someone who:

- Understands both the business domain and technical aspects
- Has excellent communication skills
- Can translate complex concepts into simple terms
- Has credibility with both business and technical areas

This role can be assumed by:
- Product Owners with a strong technical background
- Business Analysts with development experience
- Developers who have migrated to business functions
- UX Designers with a deep understanding of business and technology

Specific training is less important than the ability to effectively "translate" between areas.

### How does the Technical Specialist role differ from a traditional Tech Lead?

Although there is overlap between these roles, in the DV the Technical Specialist:

1. **Has formal responsibility** in the preliminary assessment of technical feasibility
2. **Actively participates** in business discussions and value definition
3. **Has authority** to negotiate adjustments when technical limitations arise
4. **Focuses on technical translation** for the business, not just on leading implementation

A Tech Lead can assume this role, but will need to develop additional communication skills with business areas and participate in processes that traditionally are not part of their responsibilities.

### How can we prevent the Value Analyst from becoming a bottleneck?

To prevent the Value Analyst from becoming a bottleneck:

1. **Clearly define when their participation is necessary**: Not all decisions need to go through the Value Analyst
2. **Document shared knowledge**: Create glossaries and documentation that facilitate direct communication
3. **Empower the team**: Develop "translation" skills throughout the team
4. **Consider multiple Value Analysts**: In larger projects, designate more than one person for this role

The goal is that, over time, the need for translation decreases as teams develop a shared understanding.

## Metrics and Evaluation

### How do we measure the success of DV implementation?

We recommend evaluating success in three dimensions:

**1. Process Metrics**
- Reduction in the number of unplanned scope changes
- Greater accuracy in technical complexity estimates
- Less time between impediment identification and resolution

**2. Outcome Metrics**
- Reduction in rework
- Increase in delivery predictability
- Greater stakeholder satisfaction

**3. Value Metrics**
- Measurable impact of deliveries on business KPIs
- Reduced time between conception and value generation
- Better alignment between what was delivered and what the business actually needed

Balancing these metrics is essential for a holistic evaluation.

### How do we assess if value is really being prioritized?

To verify that the focus on value is being maintained:

1. **Conduct value audits**: Periodically review delivered features and assess their real impact
2. **Compare original vs. implemented backlog**: Analyze priority changes and their justifications
3. **Interview users and stakeholders**: Collect feedback on the perceived value of deliveries
4. **Monitor business metrics**: Track KPIs related to deliveries to confirm value generation

If there is misalignment, revisit the Value Matrix and recalibrate the shared understanding of value.

### Does the DV work well in organizations that measure only deliveries, not outcomes?

This is a common challenge. We suggest:

1. **Initiate a conversation about value vs. delivery**: Propose pilots where value is explicitly measured
2. **Start with process metrics**: Demonstrate improvements in efficiency and reduction of rework
3. **Quantify the cost of valueless deliveries**: Calculate the investment in features that are rarely used
4. **Propose intermediate metrics**: Identify indicators that serve as proxies for business value

The DV can function in delivery-focused environments, but its maximum benefit comes when the organization evolves to measure outcomes and impact.

## Compatibility with Other Methodologies

### Does the DV replace Scrum or other agile methodologies?

No. The DV is complementary to agile methodologies, not a substitute. It can be implemented alongside:

- **Scrum**: Enhancing the interface between Product Owner and technical team
- **Kanban**: Improving predictability and prioritizing value in continuous flows
- **SAFe/LeSS**: Strengthening the connection between strategic and tactical levels
- **DevOps**: Extending the focus on value to operational feedback cycles

The DV resolves specific friction points at the business-technology interface that persist even with the proper adoption of these methodologies.

### How do we integrate the DV with Scrum?

Integration can occur naturally:

1. **Value Analyst**: Works closely with the Product Owner, helping with technical translation
2. **Technical Specialist**: Complements the role of Scrum Master and Tech Lead
3. **Value Matrix**: Informs Product Backlog prioritization
4. **Flexibility Contract**: Defines parameters for negotiation during Sprints
5. **Value Checkpoints**: Can be integrated into Sprint Reviews

The traditional Scrum ceremonies are maintained, with the DV enhancing the quality of interactions and decisions.

### Does the DV work in regulated environments (e.g., healthcare, finance)?

Yes, the DV is particularly valuable in regulated environments because:

1. It allows clear separation between regulatory requirements (non-negotiable) and desirable improvements
2. It provides documentation of decisions and trade-offs that may be necessary for audits
3. It maintains focus on essential value even with regulatory constraints
4. It creates mechanisms to assess the regulatory impact of technical decisions

In regulated environments, we recommend including compliance specialists in the DV process.

### How does the DV relate to Design Thinking practices?

The DV complements Design Thinking:

- **Design Thinking**: Focuses on deeply understanding user problems and needs
- **DV**: Ensures that the conceived solutions are technically feasible and deliver real value

Design Thinking's empathy and ideation practices can be incorporated into the DV's Discovery phase, while the DV's technical assessment practices complement Design Thinking's prototyping phase.

## Common Challenges

### How do we handle resistance to implementing the DV?

Resistance usually comes from legitimate concerns. Address them:

**For resistance from the technical area**:
- Demonstrate how the framework reduces pressure for unrealistic commitments
- Emphasize preliminary technical assessment and renegotiation mechanisms
- Show how the DV values long-term technical quality

**For resistance from the business area**:
- Highlight how the framework increases delivery predictability
- Show examples of how focusing on essential value generates better results
- Explain how technical transparency leads to more informed business decisions

Start with a pilot project to demonstrate tangible benefits before expanding.

### What to do when there is no consensus on what constitutes "value"?

This is a common situation and can be addressed:

1. **Conduct alignment workshops**: Gather stakeholders to define shared value criteria
2. **Adopt multiple value dimensions**: Recognize that value can include financial aspects, user experience, organizational learning, etc.
3. **Create a value hierarchy**: Establish priorities among different types of value when there are conflicts
4. **Implement validation experiments**: Define metrics to validate value hypotheses in short cycles

The important thing is to make explicit the different perceptions of value and reach a common understanding, even if temporary.

### How do we prevent the DV from becoming just another bureaucratic process?

To keep the DV agile and effective:

1. **Maintain focus on purpose**: Constantly reinforce that the goal is to deliver more value, not create processes
2. **Adapt to context**: Adjust the level of formality based on the complexity and criticality of the project
3. **Eliminate what doesn't work**: Regularly review and remove practices that are not generating benefits
4. **Measure overhead**: Monitor time spent on processes vs. value delivery work
5. **Continuously evolve**: Treat the framework itself as a product, improving it with feedback

The DV should reduce, not increase, organizational friction. If this is not happening, it's a sign that adjustments are needed.

### How do we apply the DV when business and technology areas have conflicting objectives?

This situation is precisely where the DV can bring the most benefits:

1. **Make conflicts explicit**: Clearly map where there are divergent objectives
2. **Establish shared metrics**: Define indicators that all areas agree to prioritize
3. **Create formal negotiation mechanisms**: Implement the Prioritization Committee with representatives from all areas
4. **Develop mutual empathy**: Promote job shadowing and other practices that help each area understand the challenges of the other
5. **Escalate strategically**: Define when and how to involve higher hierarchical levels to resolve impasses

The DV does not eliminate conflicts, but it provides a framework for managing them constructively.
