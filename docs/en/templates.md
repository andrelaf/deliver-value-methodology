# Templates and Tools of the Deliver-Value Framework

This section contains visual templates and practical tools to facilitate the implementation of the Deliver-Value (DV) Framework.

## Value-Technology Alignment Canvas

The Value-Technology Alignment Canvas is a visual tool to facilitate workshops integrating business and technology perspectives, following the Deliver-Value framework principles.

### Overview

The canvas structures the conversation into three main perspectives:

1. **Business Perspective**: Captures business context, expected results, and value to be delivered
2. **Technical Perspective**: Explores current capabilities, challenges, and technical risks
3. **Alignment and Agreements**: Establishes what is flexible, checkpoints, and next steps

### Available Formats

The canvas is available in multiple formats to meet different needs:

- **SVG** ([download](/docs/en/canvas/value-technology-alignment-canvas.svg)): Vectorial format ideal for high-quality printing or editing
- **PNG** ([download](/docs/en/canvas/value-technology-alignment-canvas.png)): Image for use in presentations or documents

### Example Canvas Download

- **Fully Filled Canvas** ([download](/docs/en/canvas/value-technology-alignment-canvas-example.png)): A comprehensive example of a completed canvas demonstrating real-world application

### How to Use

#### 1. Preparation
- Print the canvas in large size (recommended A1 or A0) or prepare it in a digital tool like Miro, Mural, or Figma
- Invite business and technology representatives to the workshop
- Reserve 2-4 hours for initial completion

#### 2. Facilitation
- Start by explaining the canvas's purpose and structure
- Fill in the business perspective first, then the technical one, and finally the agreements
- Use post-its or digital notes to complete each section
- Facilitate discussion using the guiding questions included in the canvas

#### 3. Documentation
- Photograph or export the completed canvas
- Document the key discussion points
- Share with all involved and keep the canvas visible throughout the project

#### 4. Review
- Review the canvas at the defined checkpoints
- Update as the project evolves and new learnings emerge

### Integration with DV Framework

This canvas directly supports the Deliver-Value principles:

- **Value over Deadline**: Focuses on clear value definition before technical issues
- **Efficient Translation**: Creates a shared visual vocabulary between business and technology
- **Preliminary Technical Assessment**: Systematically structures technical exploration
- **Formal Renegotiation**: Establishes flexibility agreements and checkpoint points
- **Continuous Transparency**: Visually documents commitments and expectations

### Use Case Example

Here's a simplified example of how the canvas might be filled for an order system renovation project:

**Business Context:**
- Current system is slow and prone to errors
- Customers abandoning orders due to frustration
- Support team overwhelmed with manual corrections

**Expected Results:**
- 50% reduction in processing time
- 70% decrease in errors
- 30% increase in conversion rate

**Current Technical Capabilities:**
- Team experienced in React and Node.js
- Existing APIs for ERP integration
- Scalable cloud infrastructure

**Technical Challenges:**
- Integration with legacy inventory system
- Historical data migration
- High availability requirements
