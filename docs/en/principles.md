# Principles and Structure of the Deliver-Value Framework (DV)

## üåü Key Principles

The Deliver-Value Framework (DV) is based on five fundamental principles:

### 1. Value Over Deadlines

The main focus should be on the value delivered to the customer, not just meeting deadlines. This implies:

- Constant prioritization based on business impact
- Willingness to reconsider scope when necessary
- Clarity about what constitutes "value" for specific stakeholders

> "It's better to deliver 80% of the value with high quality than 100% while compromising user experience or system maintainability."

### 2. Efficient Translation

Communication between business and technology requires intentional and structured translation:

- Creation of shared vocabulary between areas
- Documentation of the whys, not just the whats
- Simplification of complex concepts in both directions

> "Translation is not just explaining technical terms to the business, but also transforming business needs into measurable technical parameters."

### 3. Preliminary Technical Assessment

Before making definitive commitments, an honest technical assessment must occur:

- Investigation of limitations and dependencies
- Analysis of the feasibility of proposed solutions
- Early identification of technical risks

> "One day invested in technical assessment can save weeks of rework."

### 4. Formal Renegotiation

When new challenges arise, a structured renegotiation process should exist:

- Clear channels for escalating impediments
- Mechanisms to adjust expectations
- Culture of transparency about difficulties

> "Renegotiation is not failure, but recognition of newly discovered realities."

### 5. Continuous Transparency

Maintain clear communication at all levels of the project:

- Visibility of actual progress vs. planned
- Proactive sharing of impediments
- Honesty about capabilities and limitations

> "Transparency builds trust, even when the news is not what was expected."

## üèóÔ∏è Framework Structure

The DV is structured on three fundamental pillars:

### 1. People and Roles

#### Value Analyst

The Value Analyst is the central translator between business and technology:

- Deeply understands the business and its needs
- Translates business requirements into technical concepts
- Facilitates communication between Business/Product Specialist and Technical Specialist
- Maps and quantifies the value generated by features

#### Technical Specialist

The Technical Specialist (who may be a Team Leader, Tech Lead, or other professional with a similar function) is the guardian of technical feasibility and quality:

- Evaluates technical feasibility of proposals
- Identifies technical risks and limitations early
- Guides architectural and implementation decisions
- Ensures non-functional requirements are considered
- Bridges the gap between the technical team and product/business areas

#### Business/Product Specialist

The Business/Product Specialist represents the customer and defines priorities:

- Defines what generates the most value for the customer
- Prioritizes backlog based on value and technical feasibility
- Negotiates adjustments when necessary
- Keeps the product vision aligned with business objectives
- Translates business needs into product requirements

#### Development Team

The team that implements the solutions:

- Implements technical solutions
- Proposes alternatives when there are limitations
- Maintains technical quality and incremental delivery
- Provides feedback on complexity and feasibility

### 2. Processes

#### Discovery Phase

Before the formal start of the project:

- **Business Discovery**: Deep understanding of the problem to be solved
- **Technical Discovery**: Assessment of feasibility and initial architecture
- **Expectation Alignment**: Establishment of realistic parameters

#### Planning Phase

Collaborative definition of scope and approach:

- **Value Workshop**: Identification of the core value to be delivered
- **Technical Mapping**: Detailed assessment of complexity
- **Parameter Establishment**: Definition of timeline, scope, and resources

#### Execution Phase

Implementation with feedback cycles:

- **Iterative Cycles**: Development in sprints or continuous flow
- **Value Checkpoints**: Periodic verification of generated value
- **Technical Reassessment**: Adjustments based on new learnings

#### Delivery and Learning Phase

Conclusion and reflection:

- **Value Validation**: Confirmation of delivered value
- **Technical Retrospective**: Lessons learned and improvements
- **Documentation of Learnings**: Records for future projects

### 3. Artifacts

#### Value Matrix

Document that relates features to business value:

- Prioritized list of features
- Quantified value for each item
- Dependencies and prerequisites
- Acceptance criteria focused on value

#### Technical Complexity Map

Assessment of technical complexities and risks:

- Points of technical attention
- Effort estimates
- Technical dependencies
- Non-functional requirements

#### Flexibility Contract

Formal agreement that establishes:

- Fixed vs. flexible parameters
- Checkpoints and reassessment points
- Process for adjustments to scope or timeline
- Responsibilities of each party

#### Value vs. Progress Dashboard

Visualization of project progress:

- Planned vs. delivered value
- Technical progress
- Active impediments
- Updated predictability

## üìä Metrics and Indicators

The DV uses balanced metrics to evaluate success:

### Value Metrics

- **Value Realization Index**: How much of the planned value was effectively delivered
- **Time to First Value**: How quickly the customer perceives the first benefits
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Direct assessment of satisfaction with deliveries

### Technical Quality Metrics

- **Technical Debt Generated**: How much technical simplification was necessary
- **Maintainability**: Ease of evolving the system
- **Production Incidents**: Stability of deliveries

### Process Metrics

- **Predictability**: Accuracy of estimates
- **Renegotiation Frequency**: How many times it was necessary to adjust expectations
- **Translation Efficiency**: How well business and technology understood each other

## üîÑ Framework Adaptability

The DV is not a rigid set of rules, but an adaptable framework:

- Can be applied in different contexts (products, projects, maintenance)
- Compatible with existing agile methodologies (Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Scalable for different sizes of organizations
- Customizable according to team maturity

We encourage each organization to adapt the DV to its reality, maintaining fidelity to the fundamental principles, but making processes and artifacts flexible as needed.

## üéØ Ideal Use Cases

The DV is especially valuable in the following contexts:

- Organizations with separate Product and Engineering areas
- Projects with a high degree of technical uncertainty
- Environments where deadlines are important, but quality is essential
- Situations where there has been a history of frustration between business and technology
